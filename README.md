#### A web development project utilizing the Star Wars API (SWAPI)


## ✨Overview:
The website retrieves information from SWAPI at the user's request and displays it on the webpage. This project is built by Izebel. 

## ✨Features:
 - View information about six Star Wars movies by clicking a movie poster. 
 - View information about Star Wars characters by visiting the More Characters page.

## ✨Technologies Used:

## ✨Things I learned about working on this project:
- Axios - first time using
- Many Axios errors
- To check the Network tab in dev tools to see what came through from the API that might not be displayed
- JavaScipt promises - first time using
- How to make and remove dynamic elements with vanilla JavaScript using .createElement, .appendChild, and .removeChild 

Me learning about promises:
